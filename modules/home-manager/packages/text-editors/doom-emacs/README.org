#+title: Doom Emacs Configuration

[[./img/doom-screenshot.png]]

This is my configuration for [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Henrik Lissner's Doom Emacs]], a configuration framework for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]].
Since picking up Doom Emacs, it has quickly become my preferred way of editing text on my system.
I can have the proficiency of Vim motions thanks to [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][Evil Mode]], along with the flourishes of a GUI, like support for variable pitch fonts, all inside a consistant environment.

* My Use Cases for Doom Emacs
+ [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] to make plain text files which can get exported to a number of formats like PDF (using LaTeX), ODT, HTML, Markdown and more.
  Org files can also contain source blocks that can get concatenated to make source files, allowing for a literate programming workflow.

+ Org Agenda to keep track of tasks to do, deadlines and events.
  I use [[https://syncthing.net/][Syncthing]] to transfer my agenda files to my phone and view them with [[https://orgzly.com/][Orgzly]].

+ Searching and managing files using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]].
  Dired has the ability batch rename files by editing their names like a typical text buffer.

+ Language Server Protocols and Debug Adaptor Protocols for various programming languages.

+ Reading RSS feeds using [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][Elfeed]] along with [[https://github.com/remyhonig/elfeed-org][Elfeed-Org]] to better organise feeds.
  I typically read these feeds using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eww.html][Emacs Web Wowser (EWW)]], and watch video feeds using [[https://github.com/karthink/elfeed-tube][Elfeed-Tube]].
  I export these feeds using ~elfeed-org-export-opml~, transfer them to my phone using Syncthing, and read them using [[https://github.com/spacecowboy/Feeder][Feeder]].

+ [[https://docs.doomemacs.org/latest/modules/term/vterm/][Vterm]] for a terminal emulator in Emacs, similar to the one seen in Visual Studio Code.

+ [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] to manage Git repositories using a series of mnemonic key bindings.
