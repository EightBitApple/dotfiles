* Building a Fresh Installation
- **Initial Build requires an Internet connection.**
  If Wi-Fi does not work due to missing drivers, and Ethernet is too inconvenient in your scenario, use your mobile device's USB/Bluetooth tethering.
- Replace ~<HOSTNAME>~ with a valid host name under ~/dotfiles/hosts/~ e.g. ~desktop~, ~laptop~.

* Structure
My system and [[https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager][home-manager]] configurations.
Both configurations are managed by a flake in the root of this repository.
The system configuration imports the hosts' configurations and everything under ~./modules/nixos/~.
The home-manager configuration imports the host's configurations and everything under ~./modules/home-manager/~.
Each module can be disabled on a host-by-host bases by using the ~disabledModules~ list inside each hosts' ~configuration.nix~ and ~home.nix~.


1. Download and flash NixOS onto bootable media.
2. Boot into media.
3. Open a terminal or TTY and enter ~nix-shell -p git~ to temporarily install Git.
   You can also add your text editor of choice to this command: ~nix-shell -p git neovim~.
4. ~cd~ into ~/etc/nixos/~ and run ~git clone https://github.com/EightBitApple/dotfiles~.
5. Run ~sudo nix --experimental-features "nix-command flakes" run github:nix-community/disko -- --mode disko ./dotfiles/hosts/<HOSTNAME>/disko.nix~.
   This will partition, format and mount the drive.
6. Run ~nixos-install --flake ./dotfiles#<HOSTNAME>~ to install the system configuration.
7. Run ~nixos-enter --root /mnt'~ to chroot into the install.
8. Run ~useradd -m stefan && passwd stefan~ to create a password protected user.
   The username can be changed by modifying the ~username~ attribute in ~flake.nix~.
9. Run ~home-manager switch --flake /etc/nixos/dotfiles#laptop~ to install the home manager configuration.
10. Reboot into the new system using ~reboot~.

** TODO Make an installation script.

* Maintenance
These dotfiles install packages to aid in system maintenance:

+ [[https://github.com/viperML/nh][nh]] - Reimplements several nix commands with extra functionality.
+ [[https://gitlab.com/khumba/nvd][nvd]] - Summarises the version differences of packages between two nix store paths.
+ [[https://github.com/maralorn/nix-output-monitor][nix-output-monitor]] - Shows additional information while building.

*For the upcoming commands, Replace ~HOSTNAME~ with a directory name listed under ~~/.dotfiles/hosts~.*
*If you get a "No such file or directory" error, ~cd~ into your home directory and try again.*

** Rebuilding
+ Run ~nh os switch~ to rebuild the system.
+ Run ~nh home switch -c HOSTNAME~ to rebuild the home-manager configuration.

** Upgrading
+ Run ~nh os switch -u~ or ~nh home switch -u -c HOSTNAME~ to update ~flake.lock~ to the latest commits before rebuilding.
+ You can also run ~nix flake update~ to update ~flake.lock~ without rebuilding.

** Garbage Collection
+ Run ~nh clean all -k 4 --dry~ to see what will get deleted before cleaning for real.
        This command will delete all generations except the four latest system and home manager generations.
+ Run ~nh clean all -k 4~ to delete these generations and garbage collect the Nix Store.

** Rollbacks
This configuration hides list to choose generations when booting.
If you need to rollback to a previous generation, press any key when the POST splash screen appears.

* Roadmap
- [ ] Add secret management.
- [ ] Add home server configuration (requires secret management).
- [ ] Add Wireguard VPN configuration for home server and select hosts (requires secret management).
- [ ] Add notebook host.
